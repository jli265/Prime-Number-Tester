# Prime-Number-Tester
This programming is to test if a series of numbers are prime numbers.
You enter a positive integer N and it would help you find out all the prime numbers between 1 and N.
Math knowledge behind codes needs to be clarified beforehand.
If N is a prime number, its divisors are only 1 and itself.
If you can prove that a positive integer N>2 has no divisors that are greater than 1 and that are less than or equal to square root of N, obviously numbers between square root of N and N could not be divisors either. So this is a simplified way to test whether N is prime number or not. You do not need to test if all the potential numbers between 1 and N are divisors.
If N is even, it is not prime number. In other words, prime numbers only come from odds.
For now, choose a number N to construct a series of numbers from 1 to N and find out about how many prime numbers there are in the series.
